# Crafto Hohenvels

## 👋 Hello there
My name Crafto Hohenvels and I am working as a software developer in Germany.
Outside of that I work together with [@Pidgeon Tools](https://github.com/PidgeonTools) to create addons for [Blender](https://github.com/blender/blender) in order to improve your creative 3D workflow.
Talking of 3D and Blender, in 2020 I started making my own 3D renders, which at some point let me to the development of my own addons and [Pidgeon Render Farm](https://github.com/PidgeonTools/PidgeonRenderFarm).

## 🕊️ Pidgeon Render Farm
Pidgeon Render Farm is one of my largest and most complex projects yet.
But without the help of Pidgeon Tools I wouldn't have been able to create this app.

### ❓ What is Pidgeon Render Farm?
Pidgeon Render Farm (also known as PRF) is a render farm software for the open-source program Blender.
It helps you to connect your computers in order to render your Blender projects faster.
Most importantly your data is yours and will not leave your local network, therefore making it very secure.
After completely rewriting the project in C# it now offers highly improved performance.
